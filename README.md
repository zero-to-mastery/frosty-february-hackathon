## What is Frosty February?

Welcome to Frosty February, an inaugural (first time) event! Which we aim to make a yearly Hackathon event for the Zero To Mastery community. So how does it work?

**There are 6 projects, being led by some of your awesome Star Mentors in the Discord community. Each mentor will spend the month of February leading his or her team to complete the project they have designed to present back to the community on February 29th 2020!**

The goal is to gain experience working in teams, and building something together by the end of the month that you can be proud of and even hopefully put on your resume!

## How To Join A Project!

To make the projects manageable, the project teams are limited to 10 team members. Ensuring that you have enough free time you can dedicate to the project, clicking the `join` link on the project you would like to join from the list below. This will take you to your chosen projects dedicated discord channel, now simply enter `-joinproject` to sign up.

> #### If you are a Javascript developer then you are already familiar with how Javascript works, right?
> Well, it might not be the case. You are maybe writing Javascript code since years but still don't understand how the language works under the hood. You may have heard about terms such as "Call Stack, Callback Queue, Event Loop" but what's the deal with them?
>Did you ask yourself, *Why is that, that javascript executes my code not in order if I use a callback function with a settimeout with a delay of 0 right before the console.log?*
>
> If you are finding answers to the above questions then you found the right place. This project exactly addresses this fact & tries to explain this fundamental process visually and in words.

> We are basically building a improved version of [this awesome project](http://latentflip.com/loupe/)

# New To Opensource Projects

If you've never made a pull request before, or participated in an open source project, we recommend taking a look at our [Start Here Guidelines](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/start-here-guidelines). This repo has everything you need to learn about open source, with a step-by-step guide to making your very first PR.

# One Last Thing!

**Please note: As with all my challenges there is zero benefit or monetary gain I receive from it. This is just my way of thanking my students and making sure that you are able to continue gaining valuable knowledge outside of just my videos. It would mean a lot to me if you are able to rate my course...5 star reviews make my day :)**
